PowerShell can be used for various reconnaissance tasks, and while it does not have a direct equivalent to the `Recon-ng` framework, there are several PowerShell commands and modules that can be used for similar purposes, especially in the context of information gathering. Below are some PowerShell commands and techniques that can be used for reconnaissance:

### 1. **DNS Reconnaissance**
   - **Resolve DNS Name**: Similar to DNS lookup in Recon-ng.
     ```powershell
     Resolve-DnsName example.com
     ```

   - **Get DNS Records**: Retrieve various DNS record types.
     ```powershell
     [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry('example.com')
     ```

### 2. **Whois Lookup**
   - While there isn't a native PowerShell cmdlet for whois, you can use an external whois tool and call it from PowerShell.
     ```powershell
     whois example.com
     ```

   - Or you can use an API-based service with PowerShell to fetch whois information:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-RestMethod "https://whoisapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&domainName=example.com&outputFormat=JSON"
     ```

### 3. **IP Geolocation**
   - **Geolocation via API**: You can use an external geolocation service to retrieve information about an IP address.
     ```powershell
     Invoke-RestMethod "https://ipinfo.io/{IP_ADDRESS}/json"
     ```

   - Example:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-RestMethod "https://ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8/json"
     ```

### 4. **Enumerate Open Ports**
   - Use PowerShell to check for open ports on a target machine.
     ```powershell
     Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 80
     ```

   - Or check for multiple ports:
     ```powershell
     $ports = @(21, 22, 80, 443)
     foreach ($port in $ports) {
         Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port $port
     }
     ```

### 5. **OS Fingerprinting**
   - To retrieve the operating system of a remote machine:
     ```powershell
     Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 80
     ```
   - However, OS fingerprinting often requires more specialized tools like Nmap, which can be used from PowerShell.

### 6. **Banner Grabbing**
   - To grab banners from a specific port (similar to recon-ng modules for services), you can use PowerShell's `TcpClient`:
     ```powershell
     $tcp = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient('example.com', 80)
     $stream = $tcp.GetStream()
     $reader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($stream)
     $writer = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($stream)
     $writer.WriteLine('HEAD / HTTP/1.1')
     $writer.WriteLine('Host: example.com')
     $writer.WriteLine('')
     $writer.Flush()
     $reader.ReadToEnd()
     $tcp.Close()
     ```

### 7. **Subdomain Enumeration**
   - Subdomain enumeration can be done using APIs from services like `crt.sh` or DNSdumpster.
     ```powershell
     Invoke-RestMethod "https://crt.sh/?q=example.com&output=json"
     ```

### 8. **Brute Force or Dictionary Attack (Limited)**
   - PowerShell can be used for brute-forcing login attempts, though this should only be done with permission.
     ```powershell
     $usernames = @('admin', 'user', 'guest')
     $passwords = @('password123', 'letmein', 'admin123')
     foreach ($user in $usernames) {
         foreach ($pass in $passwords) {
             # Example of trying login, replace with actual authentication attempt
             try {
                 # Simulate login attempt (pseudo-code)
                 Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/login" -Method Post -Body @{username=$user; password=$pass}
                 Write-Output "Login successful for $user:$pass"
             }
             catch {
                 Write-Output "Failed attempt for $user:$pass"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

### 9. **Network Recon**
   - **Get Local IP Configuration**: Similar to local network enumeration in `Recon-ng`.
     ```powershell
     Get-NetIPAddress
     ```

   - **Ping Sweep**: Check the status of multiple hosts in a subnet.
     ```powershell
     $subnet = "192.168.1"
     for ($i = 1; $i -le 254; $i++) {
         Test-Connection -ComputerName "$subnet.$i" -Count 1 -Quiet
     }
     ```

### 10. **Web Scraping and Data Gathering**
   - PowerShell can scrape data from websites using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod`.
     ```powershell
     $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com"
     $html = $response.Content
     ```

   - You can use regex or HTML parsing libraries to extract specific data from the HTML response.

### 11. **Social Media Recon**
   - For social media data gathering, PowerShell can interact with APIs (e.g., Twitter API, LinkedIn, etc.), assuming you have the proper authentication tokens.
     ```powershell
     Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets?ids=ID" -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"}
     ```

### 12. **Finding Subdomains with Sublist3r**
   - `Sublist3r` is a Python tool for subdomain enumeration, but it can be called from PowerShell like this:
     ```powershell
     python sublist3r.py -d example.com
     ```

### Conclusion
While PowerShell doesn't have a direct equivalent to `Recon-ng`, it provides a versatile environment for performing various reconnaissance tasks by interacting with APIs, running system commands, and scripting network and web scanning tools. PowerShell can be integrated with other tools and frameworks like Nmap, Sublist3r, and others to enhance its reconnaissance capabilities.
